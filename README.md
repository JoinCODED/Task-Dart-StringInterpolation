# String Interpolation ➕

Given the following variables:

```dart
double temperature = 20;
String drink = 'juice';
String flavor = 'orange';
```

Use `print` and string interpolation to achieve this output in the console:

```
The temperature is 20C
I like orange juice.
```

The output should update correctly if we change the values of the variables.

For example, if temperature is 30, the output should print:

```
The temperature is 30C
```

### 🍋 Arithmetic spice

Create a new variable called `number` of type `int`:

```dart
int number = 5;
```

And achieve this output in the console:

```
5 plus 5 makes 10
```
